## Overview

This project was developed during an internship to implement a **state-of-the-art maritime surveillance system** using **YOLOv8-Large**.

The system is optimized for **real-world deployment**, handling:
- Small object detection (swimmers, buoys)
- High-resolution aerial imagery
- Occlusions and boundary artifacts
- Class imbalance common in maritime datasets

### Application Areas

- **Search and Rescue Operations**  
  Rapid detection of swimmers and lifesaving equipment.

- **Maritime Surveillance**  
  Automated monitoring of boats and jetskis from UAV footage.

- **Beach Safety**  
  Real-time swimmer tracking for public safety.

- **Marine Research**  
  Automated object counting and analytics.
